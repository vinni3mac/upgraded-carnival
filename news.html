                    <p class="text-white mb-4">
                        As some of you were made aware — and especially those of you who noticed his absence during the final leg of last year’s tour — our amazing friend and stellar bassist Brian Wynn had a beautiful baby girl! 👶💖
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white mb-4">
                        Brian’s taking some well-deserved time off the road to focus on his wonderful new family. We’re definitely going to miss his stellar bass for the upcoming tour, but we couldn’t be prouder or happier for him.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white mb-4">
                        Here’s to Brian, his wife, and their little rock star in the making. 🍻🎸
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white mb-4">
                        Much love, brother — enjoy every minute of it. We’ll hold it down until you’re back.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white mb-4">
                        With that said, we wanted to take this opportunity to assure all the fans that Eric Folsten will once again be stepping in to fill Brian’s massive shoes for the upcoming run. We’re stoked to have him back on board — the energy’s gonna be huge. ⚡️

                    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">To all fans and supporters,<br><br>
                    Vincent Mano and his team regret to inform you that, as of October 1, 2025, any and all scheduled performances will be postponed. This decision comes due to personal reasons and time constraints that would not allow the shows to meet the standard of excellence that fans deserve.<br><br>
                    This step is being taken out of respect for those who have supported the music and purchased tickets—ensuring that no one is denied the best possible experience. Vincent is committed to delivering performances that are worth the wait and will be working tirelessly in preparation for when the tour officially launches.<br><br>
                    We deeply apologize for the disappointment and inconvenience this may cause, and we thank you sincerely for your understanding, patience, and unwavering support. More details regarding rescheduled dates will be announced as soon as they are available.<br><br>
                    With gratitude,<br>
